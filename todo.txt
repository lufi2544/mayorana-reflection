////// MY REFLECTION /////

TODO:
- Watch the Casey video and start implementing the printing and test in a small project. 
- test reflection in the small project.	

PROBLEMS:

	- first thing we have to do is to parse Mayorana, once this is done, then continue with the other project files.

Parsing properties:
- Just reflect the properties with MY_PROPERTY() identifier.
- Should we reflect constexpr, const or static members?

After implementation:
- add the types to reflect dynamically, so I don't have to add them by hand every time.
- then validation for the types to make sense, and to check if the type is reflected and all that.

///// METADATA GENEARATION 
	- discuss how to print the different types.

I would like to somehow on the projects:
	- maybe generating all the types_definition for the struct first and then the member definition?
	- flags for pointer reference.
	- parse number in the tokenizer.
	- enum name iterator.
	- field iterator
	- pointer handling
	- buffer_t implementation.




TESTS:
	- test wiht a ptr of a type, like a u64 or something.
	- test with a ptr of a primitive mayorana class.
