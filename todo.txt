////// MY REFLECTION /////

Parsing properties:
- Just reflect the properties with MY_PROPERTY() identifier.
- Should we reflect constexpr, const or static members?

After implementation:
- add the types to reflect dynamically, so I don't have to add them by hand every time.
- then validation for the types to make sense, and to check if the type is reflected and all that.


I would like to somehow on the projects:
- to first, mark the properties as REFLECTED.
- create metadata ONLY from reflected properties.
- we have all the reflected properties, then we create the MetadataEnum.
- then:
	- field iterator
	- print default way a struct per project, this can be done in the proejct itself to by default print the project types.
	- property validation.
