////// MY REFLECTION /////

Parsing properties:
- Just reflect the properties with MY_PROPERTY() identifier.
- Should we reflect constexpr, const or static members?

After implementation:
- add the types to reflect dynamically, so I don't have to add them by hand every time.
- then validation for the types to make sense, and to check if the type is reflected and all that.
