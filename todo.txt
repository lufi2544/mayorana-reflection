////// MY REFLECTION /////

TODO:
- Watch the Casey video and start implementing the printing and test in a small project. 
- test reflection in the small project.


	- Generate the member_defintion enum.
	- Generate the member_definition array for every struct.
	- Generate the type_definitions for every struct.

	- Generate the type_definition table for every meta type.
	

PROBLEMS:

	- dependency chain when generating and compiling, we can introduce a type definition and we need to refer another
		type definition that is not created yet.

			-> for this we can use an id for every type and add them to a table.

Parsing properties:
- Just reflect the properties with MY_PROPERTY() identifier.
- Should we reflect constexpr, const or static members?

After implementation:
- add the types to reflect dynamically, so I don't have to add them by hand every time.
- then validation for the types to make sense, and to check if the type is reflected and all that.

///// METADATA GENEARATION 
	- discuss how to print the different types.

I would like to somehow on the projects:
	- maybe generating all the types_definition for the struct first and then the member definition?
	- flags for pointer reference.
	- parse number in the tokenizer.
	- enum name iterator.
	- field iterator
	- pointer handling
	- buffer_t implementation.
