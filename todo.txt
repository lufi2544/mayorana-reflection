////// MY REFLECTION /////

Parsing properties:
- Just reflect the properties with MY_PROPERTY() identifier.
- Should we reflect constexpr, const or static members?

After implementation:
- add the types to reflect dynamically, so I don't have to add them by hand every time.
- then validation for the types to make sense, and to check if the type is reflected and all that.


///// METADATA GENEARATION 

	- create a enum with the defenied structs- list with all the names and then create it at the end.
	- basic types, type definition.

	- discuss how to print the different types.



I would like to somehow on the projects:
- then:
	- parse number in the tokenizer.
	- enum name iterator.
	- field iterator
	- pointer handling
	- buffer_t implementation.
